      Erno Rubik is a Hungarian design teacher who was very intrigued in
      finding a way to model three dimensional movements to his students.
      Around 1974, he spent months with blocks of wood and paper, trying to
      find a way to glue them together so they could move harmonically. He
      then held the blocks with rubber bands and paper clips, finally creating
      what he called ‘Magic Cube’. 6 years later, in 1980 the invention was
      renamed the Rubik's Cube, and released as a toy from Ideal Toy & Novelty
      Company being a huge success even to this day.
