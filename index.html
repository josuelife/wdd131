        <h3>Ecuador, My country</h3>
        Ecuador is a small but packed country. It is home for Galapgos islands wich is an example of diversity and endemism. 
        Unique species reside on the islands with nearly 17 species of mammals, 152 birds, 22 reptiles and 2000 invertebrates, most of them being endemic of the islands.
